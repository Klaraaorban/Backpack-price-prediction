# 🎒 Backpack Price Prediction Challenge

## 📌 Overview
This project aims to predict the price of backpacks based on key attributes like brand, material, size, compartments, waterproof capability, style, color, and weight capacity. The goal is to build a machine learning model that accurately estimates prices using regression techniques.

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset includes:

✅ **Categorical Features** (Brand, Material, Style, Color, etc.)

✅ **Numerical Features** (Weight Capacity, Compartments, etc.)

✅ **Target Variable**: Backpack Price

## 🔥 Future Improvements
🔄 Improve feature selection

⚡ Try different regression models (XGBoost, LightGBM)

🎯 Optimize hyperparameters for better accuracy

## 🏆 Acknowledgments
This project is part of a Kaggle Challenge to improve regression modeling skills.
